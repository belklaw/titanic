# Titanic Survival Study

## Overview
This small project is centered around the chances of survival aboard the Titanic. Our aim is to showcase that even with simple techniques such as descriptive statistics and visualization, significant insights can be gleaned from data. 

## Key Findings
- Data, in its raw form, can sometimes explain its patterns without the need for complex algorithms.
- Basic statistical methods can be as informative as advanced machine learning algorithms, especially when dealing with well-structured datasets.

## Tools & Libraries
The study is conducted using classic machine learning libraries:
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

## Methodology
We emphasized the importance of data preprocessing. This involves:
- Data cleaning
- Handling missing values
- Creating informative visualizations

To reiterate, no machine learning algorithms were applied in this study. The focus was solely on understanding the data and drawing interpretations through statistical measures and visualizations.

## Getting Started
To delve deeper into our analysis, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed.
3. Run the main analysis script or Jupyter Notebook (if available).
4. Explore the visualizations and results!
