# Titanic Survival Study
# Overview
This small project is centered around the chances of survival aboard the Titanic. Our aim is to showcase that even with simple techniques such as descriptive statistics and visualization, significant insights can be gleaned from data.
# Key Findings
- Data, in its raw form, can sometimes explain its patterns without the need for complex algorithms.
- Basic statistical methods can be as informative as advanced machine learning algorithms, especially when dealing with well-structured datasets.
# Tools & Libraries
The study is conducted using classic machine learning libraries:
**Pandas*//
**Numpy*//
**Matplotlib*//
**Seaborn*//
